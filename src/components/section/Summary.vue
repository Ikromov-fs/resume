      As a skilled Node.js backend developer with over 3 years of experience, I
      have a proven track record of developing scalable and efficient
      server-side applications. My expertise includes using popular frameworks
      such as ExpressJs and NestJs, designing and implementing REST and GraphQL
      APIs, and integrating with databases such as MongoDB, DynamoDB, and
      PostgresQL. I am also experienced in leveraging cloud platforms like AWS
      to deliver high-quality software solutions. My commitment to writing
      clean, modular code, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and
      utilizing testing best practices has enabled me to consistently deliver
      high-quality results.
